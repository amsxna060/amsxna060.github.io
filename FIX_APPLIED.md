# 🔧 GitHub Actions Fix Applied!

## ❌ Previous Error:
```
npm error Missing: yaml@2.0.1 from lock file
npm error Clean install a project
```

**Root Cause:** `npm ci` requires exact package-lock.json match, but there was a version mismatch.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `npm ci` (strict install)
- ✅ Added: `npm install` (flexible install)
- ❌ Removed: `cache: "npm"` (was causing issues)

### 2. Regenerated package-lock.json
- Deleted old `package-lock.json`
- Ran `npm install` to create fresh lock file
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status:

## 📝 Technical Details:

### Why `npm ci` Failed:
- `npm ci` requires exact dependency versions from package-lock.json
- Your local package-lock.json had different versions than expected
- This happens when dependencies are installed/updated at different times

### Why `npm install` Works:
- More flexible - resolves dependencies based on package.json
- Updates package-lock.json if needed
- Better for CI/CD when lock file might be outdated

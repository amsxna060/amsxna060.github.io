# ✅ FINAL FIX - EVERYTHING WORKING!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed:

### 1. ❌ Tests Were Failing
**Problem:** Tests were using wrong React 18 API and testing wrong things

**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with proper React 18 createRoot API
```javascript
// OLD - React 17 API (doesn't work in React 18+)
ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);

// NEW - React 18 API (works!)
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
const root = createRoot(div);
root.render(<App />);
root.unmount();
```

**Result:** ✅ **Tests PASS**
```
PASS src/App.test.js
  ✓ renders without crashing (7 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
```

### 2. 🎨 Profile Photo Styling Fixed

**Your Requests:**
- ❌ No rotation
- ✅ Single solid green ring
- ✅ Glow effect ONLY on hover
- ✅ Clean, professional look

**What You Get:**

**Default State:**
- Solid green ring border
- Subtle background glow
- Clean circular shape

**On Hover:**
- 🌟 Intense green glow appears
- 💫 Slight scale up (1.02x)
- ✨ Smooth 0.3s transition

**CSS:**
```css
/* Static green ring - no rotation */
.hero-image-wrapper {
  padding: 6px;
  background: #00FF00;  /* Solid green ring */
  border-radius: 50%;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

/* Glow ONLY on hover */
.hero-image-wrapper:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.6),   /* Inner glow */
              0 0 80px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3);   /* Outer glow */
  transform: scale(1.02);  /* Subtle zoom */
}
```

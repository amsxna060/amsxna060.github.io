# 🔧 FINAL STEP - Configure GitHub Pages Source

## ✅ GitHub Actions: SUCCESS!
Your code is built and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch successfully.

## ❌ Current Issue:
GitHub Pages is still serving from the `main` branch (which has README.md), not the `gh-pages` branch (which has your built website).

---

## 🎯 FIX IT NOW (2 Minutes):

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Pages Settings
**URL:** https://github.com/amsxna060/amsxna060.github.io/settings/pages

(I just opened this in Simple Browser for you!)

### Step 2: Change the Source

Look for the **"Build and deployment"** section:

**Current Setting (WRONG):**
```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main / (root)
```

**Change To (CORRECT):**
```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: gh-pages / (root)
```

### Step 3: How to Change It

1. Under **"Source"**, it should say "Deploy from a branch" (keep this)
2. Under **"Branch"**:
   - Click the dropdown (currently shows `main`)
   - **Select: `gh-pages`**
   - Keep folder as: `/ (root)`
3. Click **"Save"** button

### Step 4: Wait
- GitHub Pages will rebuild (1-2 minutes)
- You'll see a message: "Your site is published at https://amsxna060.github.io"

---

## 🌐 Then Visit Your Site:

**https://amsxna060.github.io**

Wait 2-3 minutes after saving, then:
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Or try incognito mode

---

## 🎯 What's Happening:

### Current Flow (WRONG):
```
GitHub Pages
  ↓
Serves from: main branch
  ↓
Shows: README.md file ❌
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```
GitHub Pages
  ↓
Serves from: gh-pages branch
  ↓
Shows: Your React Portfolio ✅
```

---

## 📊 Verification:

After changing to `gh-pages` branch, you should see:

**In GitHub Pages Settings:**
```
✅ Your site is live at https://amsxna060.github.io
   Source: gh-pages branch
```

**On Your Site:**
- ✅ Hero section with your photo
- ✅ About section
- ✅ Projects section
- ✅ Skills section
- ✅ Experience section
- ✅ Contact form
- ✅ Footer

NOT the README file!

## ⚠️ Common Issues:

### If you don't see `gh-pages` in the dropdown:
1. Go to: https://github.com/amsxna060/amsxna060.github.io/branches
2. Check if `gh-pages` branch exists
3. If not, the GitHub Actions didn't deploy - check Actions tab

### If `gh-pages` exists but still shows README:
1. Make sure you selected `gh-pages` (not `main`)
2. Make sure you clicked "Save"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R`
5. Try incognito mode

### Still not working?
1. Check: https://github.com/amsxna060/amsxna060.github.io/tree/gh-pages
2. You should see `index.html`, `static/` folder, etc.
3. If you see these files, it's deployed correctly
4. The issue is just the Pages source setting

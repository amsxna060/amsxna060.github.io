## 🔍 WHY WAS IT SHOWING README BEFORE?

The issue was:
- ❌ GitHub Pages was trying to serve from the `main` branch
- ❌ The `main` branch has source code, not the built website
- ✅ GitHub Actions now builds your React app and deploys to `gh-pages` branch
- ✅ GitHub Pages will serve the built website from `gh-pages`

---

## 📝 WHAT CHANGED:

### 1. Profile Photo
- ✅ Added your photo to `/public/assets/profile-photo.jpg`
- ✅ Updated `Hero.jsx` to display your photo instead of initials
- ✅ Optimized photo size for faster loading

### 2. GitHub Actions
- ✅ Workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ Automatically builds and deploys on every push to `main`
- ✅ Creates/updates `gh-pages` branch with built files

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS:

### Step 1: Wait for GitHub Actions (2-3 minutes)

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages (if not auto-configured)
1. Go to: https://github.com/amsxna060/amsxna060.github.io/settings/pages

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If GitHub Actions Fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Common issues:
   - Node.js version mismatch (we use Node 18)
   - Missing dependencies (run `npm install` locally first)
   - Build errors (test with `npm run build` locally)

### If Site Still Shows README:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Make sure Source is set to **gh-pages** branch
3. Wait 2-3 more minutes
4. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### If You See 404 Error:
1. Check that repository name is EXACTLY: `amsxna060.github.io`
2. Make sure repository is **Public**
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for first deployment
